# MegamanX


## Introduction
This is my 1st IronHack project, based on the intro stage from the first Megaman X game. Originally lunched on 1993 on the SNES.

The objective is to shoot 20 mavericks to protect the highway of Abel City.

## Gameplay
You control X and begin with 3 lives. 

Mavericks will damage X if they touch him or if they escape!
They are destroyed with 1 shot.

To control X, use the commands:
- Shoot: Spacebar
- Jump: Up Arrow Key
- Move left: Left Arrow Key
- Move Right: Right Arrow Key

ENJOY!
